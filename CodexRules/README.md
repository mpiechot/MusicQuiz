# Codex Rules

These guidelines apply to development in this repository:

- Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Run `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` before committing changes.
- Keep documentation up to date and reflect new features or changes.
- Always follow StyleCop rules in every class.
- Enable and use nullable reference types.
- Follow C# conventions: PascalCase for types and methods, camelCase for variables and fields.
- Prefer small, focused pull requests over large, sweeping changes.
