# AI-Generated or Algorithmic Music

Modern machine‑learning models and algorithmic composition tools can produce original music that carries no traditional copyright restrictions. By generating short clips on demand or bundling pre‑generated tracks, the app can provide quiz content without relying on existing songs.

Because quiz participants usually need to recognize a tune, the generator should be able to create **sound‑alike** clips: short motifs that mimic the rhythm, harmony, or instrumentation of a popular song without reproducing the exact melody. Users could tune the generator with prompts such as “upbeat disco similar to *Stayin’ Alive*” or select from preconfigured presets that approximate well‑known styles. The resulting clip acts as a hint while remaining technically original.

## Implementation Notes
- Integrate an open‑source generator (e.g., Google's [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/), Jukebox, or MuseNet) to create short melodies offline.
- Add a “style prompt” UI so creators can request clips inspired by a given artist or track while avoiding direct copying.
- Cache generated clips for reuse and allow users to adjust style parameters (genre, tempo, mood, instrumentation).
- Provide an option to export generated music as audio files for quiz questions or embed them via the `AttachmentProvider`.
- Clearly mark generated tracks so users know they are synthetic and may not perfectly match the original song.

## Advantages
- No licensing costs or infringement risk from existing recordings.
- Endless variety; quizzes can be unique for each session.
- Allows referencing the “feel” of famous songs without distributing the actual recordings.
- Encourages creativity and experimentation among quiz creators.

## Considerations
- Quality of generated music may vary and might not match familiar tunes users expect.
- Running models locally can be resource-intensive; server-side generation or lightweight algorithms may be needed.
